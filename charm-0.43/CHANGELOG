v0.43 beta release (infrastructure changes) 
-------------------------------------------
- simplified benchmarking interface -- breaks compatibility and see docs
- added new schemes (some external contributions from Nikos Fotiou, Fan Zhang, Hoeteck Wee)
- added pre-computation optimization for group exponentiation in pairing-based modules -- see docs 
- fixed several memory leaks and segmentation faults
- switched from SHA1 to SHA2 for hashing operations
- improved serialization -- now using JSON instead of Pickle (security vulnerability)
- significant improvements to all base modules -- several fixes to integer and ecmodule functions
- more robust Android build for Charm
- significant fixes to 2.7 version of Charm

v0.42 beta release (infrastructure changes)
-------------------------------------------
- Several bug fixes to base modules (mem leaks, interface issues): pairing (PBC & Miracl), ecc, and integer
- Added new base module for RELIC and fixed bugs for MIRACL (Note: unified abstract interface for base modules coming in v0.43)
- Refactored charm package structure. This affects schemes, toolbox, adapters, etc.
- setup.py now creates Python egg
- Integrated pytest to replace unit testing framework
- Added doctests to all Charm schemes
- Updated documentation 

v0.4 beta release
-----------------
- Several bug fixes to base modules: pairing (PBC & Miracl), ecc, and integer
- Major changes to base module API. Recommend using the group abstraction wrappers: PairingGroup, ECGroup, and IntegerGroup
- Removed pairing curve params in favor of a unified 'toolbox/pairingcurve.py' with curve identifiers (e.g., SS512, MNT224, etc)
- Deleted the 'params' dir (See previous bullet)
- Added high-level serialization API to simplify managing ciphertexts and keys in applications
- Added PKCS #7 padding to toolbox
- Added public key encryption schemes: 2 new IBE schemes (ibenc_ckrs09, ibenc_lsw08)
- Added signature schemes: CL04 (anony. creds)
- Added verifiable random function (VRF) scheme
- Updates to KPABE scheme with new adapter
- Improved protocol engine: automatically store data transmitted between parties and more flexibility in state transition map  
- Updated CNS07 scheme 
- Name updates to authenticated crypto abstraction
- Updated documentation for generating group parameters and using our serialization interface
